# To-Do List Application by Lance Masina

This is my simple To-Do List application built with React and TypeScript. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application is basic in it's format but demonstrates state management, CRUD operations, and local storage. For data persistence I opted for local storage use, so your tasks will be saved even after you refresh the page or close the browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit the text of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from their to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- **Local Storage:** The application uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Local Storage:** Web storage for storing data in the browser.

## FEEDBACK

I gladly welcome any feedback or ways that I could refactor some of the syntaxes. Feel free to ping me a DM or follow below.
